//My TypeScript Journey

//https://www.typescriptlang.org

/*TypeScript (TS) is a statically typed superset of 
JavaScript that adds optional static typing, advanced 
tooling, and improved developer experiences to 
JavaScript-based web and application development. 
It compiles to plain JavaScript, making it compatible 
with all JavaScript environments. TypeScript helps 
catch type-related errors at compile-time, provides 
enhanced code navigation and autocompletion, and is 
widely used for building scalable and maintainable web 
and software applications. */
